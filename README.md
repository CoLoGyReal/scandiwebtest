There is an image slider for PC and mobile devices with swipes. It can work with any HTML content and different images. You can change an image by yourself. Add new URL-link to the HTML file in line with img and paste it to the src. If you want to change it to another content, you can delete an image and paste something new. Also you can add more slides by adding content to div with "slides" class. Next point is changing "dots-container" div. You need to add one more btn by adding a div with a "dot-item" class. I hope it will be usefull for you! 

Have a good day ;)
